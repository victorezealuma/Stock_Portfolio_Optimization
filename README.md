This project provides a Python script for stock portfolio optimization. The script uses a mean-variance optimizer to find the optimal portfolio weights for a given set of assets. The user can specify the assets to include in the portfolio, the expected return and volatility of each asset, and the correlation between the assets. The script will then calculate the optimal portfolio weights and return the expected return and risk of the portfolio.
